        <p>His heart started beating faster as he climbed.</p>
<p>Every new step pumped an ounce more adrenaline to his veins.</p>
<p>He was breathing faster.</p>
<p>The wind soothed him.</p>
<p>But at this moment peace terrorised him.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>The walk to the edge was the toughest.</p>
<p>It was as if he forgot how to walk.</p>
<p>Trembling on every step, he reached the edge.</p>
<p>He knew he wasn’t brave enough to be there.</p>
<p>Yet there he was.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the courage to look down.</p>
<p>The wind rustled beneath his feet and played with his hair.</p>
<p>The silence and calmness up there contrasted with the busy street below.</p>
<p>Far below.</p>
<p>The sky seemed conquerable from here.</p>
<p>He would soon do that anyway.</p>
<p>He loved the view.</p>
<p>He felt like God.</p>
<p>The wind beckoned him.</p>
<p>He looked up to the sky,</p>
<p>It looked like an ocean beside a desert.</p>
<p>Soon he would be swimming in that ocean.</p>
<p>He just had to let go of his fears.</p>
<p>He took two more steps.</p>
<p>Now, there’s nothing in-front of him.</p>
<p>Nothing solid.</p>
<p>He had to arch a bit backwards so as to counter the pull of the wind.</p>
<p>Gravity seemed to get stronger with every second.</p>
<p>Gravity was the one thing that he longed to defeat, his greatest enemy.</p>
<p>He was sure though, that he would be the one who wins tonight,</p>
<p>Not gravity.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and then held it.</p>
<p>His heartbeat made him deaf.</p>
<p>He raised both his hands to his shoulders.</p>
<p>Straightened up.</p>
<p>And dove.</p>
<p>Weightless.</p>
<p>He was flying.</p>
<p>His heart was beating so fast, he couldn’t hear it anymore.</p>
<p>Adrenaline replaced blood.</p>
<p>He won!</p>
<p>The world was getting closer.</p>
<p>He was laughing.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He loved it.</p>
<p>Everything stopped.</p>
<p>He was numb.</p>
<p>The sky seemed so far right now.</p>
<p>He was suddenly so sleepy.</p>
<p>He fought to keep his eyes open.</p>
<p>He tried to raise his hand.</p>
<p>Nope. He was so tired.</p>
<p>He was afraid that he won’t be able to open his eyes if he closed them.</p>
<p>He had to.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
