      "content": "<p>For those of you who don't know, (which is going to be most of you), I recently published my very first crate; <a href=\"https://github.com/bahdotsh/zp\">zp</a>. <code>zp</code> is just a simple tool to copy contents from a file. I built zp so that I can learn rust properly. And by properly, I mean learning something and understanding it in a way I can use it to build cool/useful things in the future.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>The process was relatively simple than I expected and as everyone says, the toughest thing was deciding what to build. Thankfully, I didn't overthink it this time and decided to build something not complex at all. My problem statement was simple, &quot;I need a tool to copy things from inside a file to the clipboard from my terminal&quot;. Since the problem statement was so clear, I was able to break it down into smaller parts and publish it in a day!</p>\n<p>I was really excited when the development reached the final stages as it was working exactly how I wanted it to work. I don't know if you know, but the following are the steps to publish your crate to <a href=\"https://crates.io/\">crates.io</a> :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository\">license</a> to your project.</li>\n<li>Put up a proper <code>README.md</code> file.</li>\n<li>Set your package information like version, description, license, etc. in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file.</li>\n<li>Build your project, <code>cargo build --release</code></li>\n<li>And finally, publish your project with <code>cargo publish</code> (you need to first create an account in crates.io and generate an API key to log in to your account from the terminal).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yup, that's it! You have now published your crate. And what that means is that people will see your project and may even use it! That reality hit me a little late. I was really proud of my accomplishment and posted it everywhere I could think of.</p>\n<p>This is when the reality of other people using my project hit kind of hard. A couple of developers used it and as it turns out, my project doesn't work at all in Linux and Windows! I should've checked it, but I didn't. My embarrassment has never reached highs like this before and was kind of hard to deal with.</p>\n<p>Followed by this, an interesting phenomenon started to happen, people started giving me suggestions to improve my project. It was so refreshing and humbling to see really cool people giving me some really cool feedback!</p>\n<p>What that means is that I will get to learn rust a little bit more in-depth, and of course, improve my project in the process. The first obvious feedback I'm going to work on is to make my project cross-platform compatible, and will soon be dropping a blog on that later.</p>\n<p>Also since you have read this much, do check out my <a href=\"https://gokuls.in/blog/\">blog</a>!</p>\n",

To use the <code>zp</code>,</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>simply open your terminal or command prompt (well install it first) and type <code>zp</code> followed by the name of the source file. For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-\">zp my_file.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>To get the first <code>n</code> words of the  file :</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-\">zp -s n my_file.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>To get the lines between a range, i.e., to get lines from <code>n</code> till <code>m</code> of the file:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-\">zp -s n -e m my_file.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also you can use zp to copy from the std output buffer :</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-\">cat sample_file.txt | zp\n</code></pre>\n<p>This copies the entire output of the file.</p>\n<p>You can use get a range of lines and the first n words also from the std output buffer :</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-\">cat sample_file.txt | zp -s 2\n\ncat sample_file.txt | zp -s 2 -e 5\n</code></pre>\n<p>This gets the first 2 words and lines from 2 to 5 of the sample_file.txt respectively</p>\n<p>This will copy the contents of &quot;myFile.txt&quot; to the clipboard.</p>\n<h3>Logs and History</h3>\n<p>Every copied content is saved to a history file, allowing you to revisit previously copied entries. To view the copy history, use:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-\">zp --logs\n</code></pre>\n<p>The &quot;zp&quot; command is particularly useful for quickly copying text or data from one file to another without having to manually select and copy the text. This can save time and effort, especially when working with large or complex files.</p>\n<h2>Install</h2>\n<p>It's best to use rustup to get setup with a Rust toolchain, then you can run:</p>\n<p><code>cargo install zp</code></p>\n<h3>From source</h3>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-\">git clone https://github.com/bahdotsh/zp.git\ncd zp\ncargo install --path .\n</code></pre>",

Whatever your mother tongue is, it was taught to you by the people around you. Not only your mother tongue, whatever language you learn, somebody taught it to you. They taught you that language not to make you a poet or a writer, but to exchange their opinions and believes onto you.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? Your thoughts are not yours. Your thoughts are the byproduct of your interactions with an “educated” environment. You are getting influenced everyday. You are totally blind to what you are learning. You are only thinking what you are supposed to think. The reason you can’t think beyond the 26 letters of the English alphabets is only because you don’t have to. Everybody around you thinks with those 26 letters. You’re just thinking whatever you’re thinking only because you want to co-exist with the people around you.</p>\n<p>If our thoughts are not really ours, then what do we have?</p>\n<p>Let me end with something one of my professors said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Whatever you have learnt was taught to you.

Root node is the node which is present at the topmost part of the tree. <em><strong>Keys</strong></em> are the values stored inside each of the nodes. <em><strong>Edges</strong></em> are the connection between one node and the other. <em><strong>Parent nodes</strong></em>(R is the parent of C and D)are nodes which have a branch from one node to the another and the <em><strong>child nodes</strong></em>(A and B are the child nodes of Q) are the nodes connected to the parent nodes. The children of the same parent node are called <em><strong>sibling nodes</strong></em>(E, F, G and A, B and C, D and H, I and Q, R are all siblings respectively). And the nodes with no children are called <em><strong>leaf nodes</strong></em>(H, I, D, and B are all leaf nodes). Now the number of edges between a node and the root node is called the depth of the node. For example, let’s take the node ‘A’. A is connected to Q and Q is connected to P(root node). There are two edges between A and P. Therefore the depth of A is 2. Note that the depth of the root node is 0. Level of a node is nothing but depth of the node + 1. Which means the level of A is 3.</p>\n<p>Whew, that was a lot of definitions. The good news is you don’t have to try hard and remember any of those. Once you have compared the definitions to the picture of the tree above, you can easily understand what they mean. And then the next time you see a tree, you can easily understand them in a glance.</p>\n<p>So after knowing the terms used in building trees, we can say that a tree is nothing but a collection of nodes.</p>\n<h3>Merkle Trees</h3>\n<p>Ok, as you are now familiar with trees let’s get to business. What are these Merkle trees? Merkle trees are a fundamental part of blockchain technology. One of the main reasons why blockchain is super famous is because of the security and efficient storage of data. Merkle trees are used to achieve this. It helps in efficient and secure verification of content in a large body of data.</p>\n<p>If you forgot what hashing means, quickly go to my previous <a href=\"https://blog.gokuls.in/how-does-blockchain-work-1/\">previous</a> article and read up on it and come back. It’ll only take you a few minutes and will help you understand what I’m going to tell you next better.</p>\n<p>In a Merkle tree, each leaf node is a hash of a block of data, and each parent node is a hash of its children. Yeah, that’s it. It’s that simple. Also to make things more simpler, Merkle trees usually have a branching factor of 2. Don’t frown, my friend, it just means that each node has children. Merkle trees are created by repeatedly hashing pairs of nodes until there is only one hash left (this hash is called the <em><strong>Root Hash</strong></em>, or the <em><strong>Merkle Root</strong></em>). They are constructed from the bottom up, from hashes of individual transactions. The Merkle Root summarizes all of the data in the related transactions and is stored in the block header (a block header is the unique identity of a particular block on a blockchain and is hashed by miners for rewards). It maintains the integrity of the data. If a single detail in any of the transactions or the order of the transactions changes, so does the Merkle Root. Using a Merkle tree allows for a quick and simple test of whether a specific transaction is included in the set or not.</p>\n<p>Merkle trees are powerful and indispensable tools for miners and users on the blockchain. They are extremely robust and are at the heart of several peer-to-peer networks such as BitTorrent, Git, Bitcoin, and Ethereum.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Blockchain is a combination of several different technologies. For making it easier for you, I have broken it down into simpler parts. This is the first part of this series and it’s all about one of the most important technologies used in blockchain; <em><strong>cryptography</strong></em></p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>What is cryptography?\nThe prefix “crypt” means “hidden” and the suffix “graphy” means “writing.” Since that is out of the way, let’s see what it is. But before that let’s do something fun. Let’s create a secret code. Exciting, isn’t it? Let’s say that we have to subtract ‘1’ from each of the letters in our code to find the original letter. Cool. Since we have created a code and both of us know how to read it, if I write “BQQMF” both of us can easily understand what that means. But if you show it to your friend who has no clue about our secret code, it’d just be a senseless word for him.</p>\n<p>This is what cryptography is. It’s a technique to secure information and communications through codes which only the sender and receiver can understand. When I changed “APPLE” to “BQQMF” what I did was encryption. And when you cracked the code, what you did is called decryption</p>\n<p>When you learn about a particular technique you’ll have to remember some terms associated with it. Like encryption and decryption, there are a bunch of other simple words associated with cryptography. Let’s see what they mean.</p>\n<p>Let’s take our example. In the world of cryptography, the word APPLE which we encrypted is called plain text, and the code BQQMF is called ciphertext. You won’t be able to read BQQMF as APPLE if I didn’t tell you how to read it, that is, to subtract 1 from each letter. So ‘-1’ is what we call the key of our cryptographic algorithm. Without which we won’t be able to understand what each of us is saying.</p>\n<p>Now let’s see some of the types of cryptography.</p>\n<h3>Symmetric Key Cryptography</h3>\n<p>In this system both the sender and receiver use a single key for encryption and decryption. Our cryptographic algorithm is an example of Symmetric key cryptography.</p>\n<h3>Asymmetric Key Cryptography</h3>\n<p>You can easily guess what this would mean from the previous definitions. Yes, you’re correct, in this cryptographic system, there are two types of keys, a <em><strong>public key</strong></em> and a <em><strong>private key</strong></em>. The public key is used for encryption and the private key is used for decryption. Both the keys would be different. Even if the public key is known to everyone, only the intended receiver can decode it because he alone knows the private key.</p>\n<p>Asymmetric encryption can be likened to a mailbox on the street. The mailbox is completely public — anyone who knows its location could go to it and drop in a letter. However, only the owner of the mailbox has a key which allows him to access it and read the letters. The location of the mailbox is the public key, something that is known to the public. The private key is with the owner of the mailbox, which is used to access the mailbox.</p>\n<h3>Hash Functions</h3>\n<p>In this algorithm, there is no key. These functions change the entire plain text to a new encrypted form, called the hash value. The hash value will be of the same length for whatever plain text fed into it. Since there is no key it is nearly impossible for the contents of the plain text to be recovered.</p>\n<p>Public key cryptography and hash functions are used throughout blockchain. There is also another interesting cryptographic technique used inside blockchain called <em><strong>Merkle Trees</strong></em>. A Merkle tree (or hash tree) is a tree that utilizes cryptographic hash functions to store hash outputs instead of raw data in each node. We’ll see what they mean in-depth in the coming articles.</p>\n",
